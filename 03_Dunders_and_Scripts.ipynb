    "## Dunders\n",
    "### A rose by any other name would smell as sweet\n",
    "\"Dunder\" is a contraction of \"double underscore\", with the first documented use of said contraction being from a mailing list posting by Mark Jackson in 2002 (Schlawack, 2015).  \n",
    "There are a number of other popular names for dunders, including \"double-underscore methods\", and \"magic methods\" (Schlawack, 2015).\n",
    "\n",
    "They are so named because they start and end with double underscores: for instance, like \"`__init__`\". These are special methods that define how objects interact with built-in operations and functions in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Model\n",
    "To better understand dunders, we need to first briefly discuss what the Python Data Model is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Egges (2023) summarizes the Python language as being created with simplicity and readability in mind; everything is an object in Python, and this choice led to the development of the Python data model: rules that define how objects (and by extension, everything in Python) behave in Python, with dunders being central to this.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Every object has an identity, a type and a value.  \n",
    "> ...  \n",
    "> An object’s type determines the operations that the object supports (e.g., “does it have a length?”) and also defines the possible values for objects of that type. The `type()` function returns an object’s type (which is an object itself). Like its identity, an object’s type is also unchangeable.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> *\\- Python Software Foundation (2023)*\n",
    "\n",
    "It is desirable for differently typed objects to exhibit different behaviour when acted upon by the same operator as needed. For instance, when you use the `+` operator between 2 numbers, you would typically expect to obtain the arithmetic sum of the two. On the other hand, if you used the same `+` operator on text, you'd naturally want the two bits of text to be concatenated. Such behaviour is defined in the dunders for the built-in types.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(1 + 2)  # prints out `3`\n",
    "print(\"This and \" + \"that\")  # prints out `This and that`\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Dunder methods are typically invoked by the Python interpreter. For example, we mentioned \"`__init__`\" earlier; whenever an object is instantiated (for now, you can just think of \"instantiation\" as the object being created - the nuances won't matter for the purposes of this notebook), the \"`__init__`\" method defined for that object is run. As for the `+` operator we just saw, the corresponding dunder is \"`__add__(self, other)`\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the built-in dunders define default built-in behaviour of objects, we can override them to customize the behaviour of objects as we see fit. This means that if we override the \"`__init__`\" function when defining an object, then we can change the default initialization logic for that object. Or, if we override the \"`__add__`\" method, then we can change what happens when you use `+` between two such customized objects.\n",

    "For one, excessive use/abuse of dunders could result in unnecessary complexity that makes your code harder to read/understand (Egges, 2023). This can be further complicated when the overridden dunders result in unexpected behaviour - also known as violating the principle of least astonishment, or POLA for short (Egges, 2023). For instance, the earlier mentioned example of overriding dunders for built-in types: changing how built-in types work can result in very confusing code since most people would expect them to work the way they are defined by the Python Software Foundation.\n",

    "Aside from potential readability issues, there are also potential performance issues. Recall that dunders are typically invoked by the Python interpreter. They are often invoked internally by Python in many different places that might not be obvious/apparent to you (Egges, 2023). As such, inefficient and/or poorly written dunders can end up slowing the code down (Egges, 2023)."
