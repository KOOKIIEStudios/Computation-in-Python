    "## About The Course\n",
    "This course teaches computation using Python as a medium. We will be looking at some of the core soft skills needed in computing, as well as the basics of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expectations\n",
    "This course will provide a cursory explanation on the following topics:\n",
    "- Computational Thinking\n",
    "- Algorithms\n",

    "Let's try out a quick exercise!\n",
    "\n",
    "Brandon wishes to apply for a loan to support his crippling TCG addiction. Bank A offers a 5 year loan at 3%, compounded quarterly. Bank B offers a 10 year loan at 7%, compounded annually. Brandon reckons that he wants to sink at least a thousand dollars into Pokemon TCG. Which deal is better for him?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break the problem down. To know which deal is better we need to calculate what is the total he will have to repay either banks. This means that we will need to use an appropriate formula to calculate the amount owed at the end of each loan term, and then compare to see which one is lower. In other words, we have decomposed the initial problem into the following steps:  \n",
    "1. Calculate interest for bank A\n",
    "2. Calculate interest for bank B\n",
    "3. Check which value is lower (the better deal)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we notice that both loans are using compound interest, albeit compounded at different frequency (pattern recognition), and that the principal is the same in both cases. This step might not be significant in a one-off case, but we'll keep this piece of information in mind for now. We'll now refine the three steps we came up with, using information we noticed:\n",
    "1. Calculate $(1000 * (1 + \\frac{\\frac{3}{4}}{100})^{4*5}) - 1000$\n",
    "2. Calculate $(1000 * (1 + \\frac{\\frac{7}{1}}{100})^{1*10}) - 1000$\n",
    "3. Check which value is lower (the better deal)\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the relatively contrived example we're using, it's simple enough that after one round of decomposition we already arrived at an algorithm: a sequence of instructions. Naturally, we might want to break this down even more when programming for machines, which we'll get into in later chapters."

    "\n",
    "Well, if we're performing calculations by hand there's nothing we can do but re-calculate manually. But we'll circle back to this when we talk about *procedures/functions* in later chapters, and make this solution more generic, so as to automate the decision process for Brandon.

Most people who are just starting out in computing would probably think the same, only to find themselves stuck when encountering tougher problems later on. A big part of getting better at solving more difficult problems is recognizing when you've not broken down your problem into small enough pieces. So if you find yourself in a pickle, perhaps consider whether any of the steps in your algorithm should be broken down further (and for the love of God, *please* plan before you code)."

This makes it a transferable soft skill across all programming languages: computational thinking is *language-agnostic*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, having the algorithm at hand allows us to pick the right language and/or framework. Harking back to the previously made analogy of tools in toolboxes: sure, you can simply pick your favourite tool in your toolbox and do *everything* using that one tool. But it would be advantageous to first know what kind of work you'll be doing, and then picking the most appropriate tool for that job. You *could* choose to carry only a pair of pliers to perform any and every job; or, you could also first analyze and realise that you need to unscrew some nuts and bolts and then choose to use wrenches.\n",
