# About
This course intends to be an introduction to computing, using Python as a medium. We will be looking at some of the core soft skills needed in computing, alongside some basic Python - this includes various common idioms and techniques that should be enough to get newbies started on their programming journey.

## Tech Stack
This course targets modern Python and will require Python 3.10 or newer.  
We have taken the liberty of preparing the course materials using only the standard library, so we will not need to rely on any external libraries aside from Jupyter.  

### Instructions

Pre-requisites:
- Python installation (added to PATH)
- Jupyter installation
    - Use the command `pip install jupyter` in an administrative prompt to install this

1. Clone the repository
    - e.g. `git clone git@github.com:KOOKIIEStudios/Computation-in-Python.git`
2. Navigate to the project root in the terminal
    - e.g `cd Computation-in-Python`
3. Start the Jupyter Notebook server
    - Use the command `jupyter notebook`
    - The above command will open up a web browser
4. Double click on the notebook you wish to open
    - e.g. `01_Computation_and_Algorithms.ipynb`
    - Notebooks are ordered and numbered by recommended sequence

### Optional
Because this course uses Jupyter Notebook, it can be completed using just the web browser. However, should one prefer, popular text editors and IDEs like VS Code and PyCharm Professional do offer Jupyter integrations as well. You may choose to use those instead of working in the browser (although these are unnecessary and overkill for the purposes of this course).
