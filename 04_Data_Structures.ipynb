    "\n",
    "In contrast with using variables, it's also possible to perform computations with raw literals. For instance, if we want to perform the compound interest calculation from notebook 2, we can choose to write the numbers in directly - these are called \"magic numbers\"\n",

    "\n",
    "It's important to note that you can't simply name variable however you like. There are a few key points to remember as a beginner; for more in-depth rules, you may refer to [*PEP 8*](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#naming-conventions) for styling recommendations, as well as [*The Python Language Reference*](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/lexical_analysis.html#identifiers) for the nitty gritty details of what constitutes a legal name in Python; the pointers given here have been extracted from the two resources listed above:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Names can contain Unicode letters, [numbers](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/category/Nd), [nonspacing marks](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/category/Mn), [spacing combining marks](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/category/Mc), and [connector punctuations](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/category/Pc)\n",
    "    - Unicode letters span many languages, and not just the Latin characters used in ASCII\n",
    "      - e.g. &#226; and &#462; are legal\n",
    "      - I would personally sticking to common letters - characters that are cumbersome to type out would probably be more trouble than they're worth\n",
    "2. Names can only start with Unicode letters, [Letter Numbers](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/category/Nl), and underscores\n",
    "    - Letter numbers: &#8544;, &#8545;, &#8546;, &#8547;\n",
    "    - There are certain other special characters that are supported for backwards compatibility, but you probably don't need to know this\n",
    "3. Names are case-sensitive\n",
    "4. Try to keep names short and descriptive\n",
    "    - There's no hard limit on the length, but it's best to keep things straight to the point\n",
    "5. Use `snake_case` for packages, modules, functions, variables\n",
    "6. Use `CamelCase` for classes\n",
    "7. Use `UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES` for constants\n",
    "8. Leading and trailing underscores have special meaning\n",
    "    - `_single_leading` and `single_trailing_` underscores are special by convention (they don't really do anything under the hood)\n",
    "    - `__double_leading` and `__double_leading_and_trailing__` have special meanings under the hood (remember *dunders* from the previous notebook?)"
