    "So you might be slightly confused by this word \"assignment\" that you just read. You've previously already seen the use of the `=` sign in-use with variables in provided code demonstrations. This is known as the assignment operator, which should not be confused with equality in mathematics (usually denoted as `==` in most programming languages instead).\n",

    "Or, we can also say, that the expression is evaluated and the resulting value is associated with the name in the namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that since the right hand side is an expression, chaining assignments on the same line is legal in Python.\n",
    "```py\n",
    "a = b = c = d = 69\n",
    "```\n",
    "In Python, chained assignments happen from left to right (which may be  different from other languages like C).\n",

    "c = get_deez()\n",
    "a = c\n",
    "b = c\n",

    "```py\n",
    "list_1 = list_2 = list()\n",

    "temp = x  # store 6 in temp\n",
    "x = y\n",
    "y = temp  # 6 now goes into y\n",

    "\n",
    "It's important to note that you can't simply name variable however you like. There are a few key points to remember as a beginner; for more in-depth rules, you may refer to [*PEP 8*](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#naming-conventions) for styling recommendations, as well as [*The Python Language Reference*](https://docs.python.org/3.12/reference/lexical_analysis.html#identifiers) for the nitty gritty details of what constitutes a legal name in Python; the pointers given here have been extracted from the two resources listed above:\n",

    "    - Example of letter numbers: &#8544;, &#8545;, &#8546;, &#8547;\n",
    "    - There are certain other special characters that are supported for backwards compatibility, but you probably don't need to know this\n",
    "3. Names are case-sensitive\n",
    "4. Try to keep names short and descriptive\n",
    "    - There's no hard limit on the length, but it's best to keep things straight to the point\n",
    "5. Use `snake_case` for packages, modules, functions, variables\n",
    "6. Use `CamelCase` for classes\n",
    "7. Use `UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES` for constants\n",

    "    - This is an *exact* representation - as of Python 3, these are now unlimited in size; they will grow as big as you have space in your memory (RAM)\n",
    "- `float`: Floating Point numbers\n",
    "    - You may think of these as kinda the same as decimals (e.g. `3.14`) for now\n",
    "    - All you need to know is that these are *imprecise*, and only good for something like 7-15 decimal places (depending on implementation)\n",
    "        - Python uses double-precision floats, so it's closer to 15 dp\n",
    "    - The actual difference isn't particularly important for beginners, but ICYWW...\n",
    "    - Given limits to computer memory, it's obvious that actual decimals are tricky to deal with - this is especially true with long chains of divisions that causes errors to be carried forward\n",
    "        - Floating-point arithmetic is a pain point in computing, with stuff like IEEE standards to help keep things sane. Heck, even *Google* themselves recently just made a new type of floating point for use in AI-related computation called BFloat16 to optimise performance on their TPU chips\n",
    "- `complex`: Complex Numbers (yeah, it supports Imaginary Numbers!)\n",
    "    - Syntax is similar to how we write it in math: `6 + 9j` (no space before `j`)\n",
    "    - Complex Numbers have `.real` and `.imag` properties to extract only the real and imaginary parts\n",
    "- `bool`: Booleans (i.e. `True` or `False`)\n",
    "    - `True` and `False` need to be capitalized\n",
    "- `str`: String (basically text, in a nutshell)\n",
    "    - Other languages have a Character data type, where String is a collection of Characters\n",
    "    - Python does not: single characters are still Strings, since Strings are a decoding of bytes in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Also common, are collections - these are data types that can store other data types inside them, like `list` or `set`.\n",
